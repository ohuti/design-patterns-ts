# Design Patterns using Typescript
This repo's purpose is to initially help me study design patterns and later be used as a consulting source.

This study was based on a web book "Dive Into Design Patterns" from the website [Source Making](https://sourcemaking.com/) inside the [Design Patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns) section.

Enjoy!
